# PG-Minigames
Goals
The overall goal was to build a card game app where you would be able to play
multiple card games. The game I chose to work on was go-fish. With my part of 
the game being incomplete, there are several things i would like to finish. 
Stylized cards,score system, another player either computor or person, and
being able to ask what cards are just some of the main goals.
